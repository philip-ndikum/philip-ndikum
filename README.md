# Philip Ndikum

Multi-sector specialist building mathematical & computational systems at scale in finance & technology with billion-dollar impact teams (C-suite driven initiatives with multimodal data). Scientific & engineering advisory, consulting & contracting. Previous CTO & Founder roles. Independent and proprietary software systems (incubated at Harvard, MIT, Oxford). Pro-bono volunteering, teaching & mentoring experience. 

## ðŸ“– Education

Academic focus spanned mathematical and computational sciences, emphasizing mathematical finance and physics (ODEs, PDEs, SDEs), numerical analysis, and stochastic simulations. Core implementations in Python and C++, supplemented by Julia for stochastic simulations and MATLAB for linear algebra. Education enriched by time series analysis and projects across sectors, integrating formal business school modules and advanced teaching in Mathematical Physics (Harvard) and Finance (Oxford).
